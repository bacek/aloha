=head1 NAME

Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Infobot - infobot clone redone in B::B::P.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.88

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Does infobot things - basically remembers and returns factoids. Will ask
another infobot about factoids that it doesn't know about, if you want. Due
to persistent heckling from the peanut gallery, does things pretty much
exactly like the classic infobot, even when they're not necessarily that
useful (for example, saying "Okay." rather than "OK, water is wet."). Further
infobot backwards compatibility is available through additional packages
such as L<Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Foldoc>.

=head1 IRC USAGE

The following examples assume you're running Infobot with its defaults settings,
which require the bot to be addressed before learning factoids or answering
queries. Modify these settings with the Vars below.

  <user> bot: water is wet.
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: water?
   <bot> user: water is wet.
  <user> bot: water is also blue.
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: water?
   <bot> user: water is wet or blue.
  <user> bot: no, water is translucent.
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: water?
   <bot> user: water is translucent.
  <user> bot: forget water.
   <bot> user: I forgot about water.
  <user> bot: water?
   <bot> user: No clue. Sorry.

A fact that begins with "<reply>" will have the "<noun> is" stripped:

  <user> bot: what happen is <reply>somebody set us up the bomb.
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: what happen?
   <bot> user: somebody set us up the bomb.

A fact that begins "<action>" will be emoted as a response:

  <user> bot: be funny is <action>dances silly.
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: be funny?
    * bot dances silly.

Pipes ("|") indicate different possible answers, picked at random:

  <user> bot: dice is one|two|three|four|five|six
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: dice?
   <bot> user: two.
  <user> bot: dice?
   <bot> user: four.
  
You can also use RSS feeds as a response:

  <user> bot: jerakeen.org is <rss="http://jerakeen.org/rss">.
   <bot> user: okay.
  <user> bot: jerakeen.org?
   <bot> user: jerakeen.org is <item>; <item>; etc....

You can also ask the bot to learn a factoid from another bot, as follows:

  <user> bot: ask bot2 about fact.
   <bot> user: asking bot2 about fact...
  <user> bot: fact?
   <bot> user: fact is very boring.

Finally, you can privmsg the bot to search for particular facts:

  <user> search for options.
   <bot> I know about 'options indexes', 'charsetoptions override', etc....

=head1 METHODS



=head1 VARS

=over 4

=item min_length

Defaults to 3; the minimum length a factoid, or inquiry, must be before recognizing it.

=item max_length

Defaults to 25; the maximum length a factoid, or inquiry, can be before ignoring it.

=item num_results

Defaults to 20; the number of facts to return for "search for <term>" privmsg.

=item passive_answer

Defaults to 0; when enabled, the bot will answer factoids without being addressed.

=item passive_learn

Defaults to 0; when enabled, the bot will learn factoids without being addressed.

=item require_question

Defaults to 1; determines whether the bot requires a question mark before 
responding to a factoid. When enabled, the question mark is required (ie. "water?").
When disabled, the question mark is entirely optional (ie. "water" would also
produce a response).

=item stopwords

A comma-, space-, or pipe- separated list of words the bot should not learn or
answer. This prevents such insanity as the learning of "where is the store?" and
"how is your mother?" The default list of stopwords contains "here", "how", "it",
"something", "that", "this", "what", "when", "where", "which", "who" and "why").

=item unknown_responses

A pipe-separated list of responses the bot will randomly choose from when it
doesn't know the answer to a question. The default list of response contains
"Dunno.", "I give up.", "I have no idea.", "No clue. Sorry.", "Search me, bub.",
and "Sorry, I don't know."

=item allow_searching

Defaults to 0. 

Searching on large factoid lists is ... problematic.

=item http_timeout

Time in seconds for an http request to timeout. When this value is
set to a very high value, a slow site can disconnect a bot by
blocking it. Defaults to 10.

=item rss_items

Maximal numbers of items returns when using RSS feeds. Defaults to 5.

=back

=head1 BUGS

"is also" doesn't work on <reply>s (ie. "<bot> cheetahs! or <reply>monkies.")

"is also" doesn't work on <action>s (same as the previous bug, hobo.)

The pipe syntax for random replies doesn't actually work. At all. Um.

We should probably make a "choose_random_response" function.

"<bot>?" fails, due to removal of <bot> name from $mess->body.

"ask" syntax doesn't work in a private message.

The tab stops are set to 2, not 4. OHMYGOD.

If a "search" fails, the bot doesn't tell you.

"search" is case-sensitive.

If Title module is loaded, <rss> factoids don't work cos of told/fallback.
